# Gwt-pixi-demo
This is just demo project for [Pixi gwt](https://github.com/klaun76/gwt-pixi). Really nothing to be proud of. Main purpose of this demo is to quickly test all possible problems caused by changes and updates in [Pixi gwt](https://github.com/klaun76/gwt-pixi).
# How to use
Just copy gwt-pixi and gwt-pixi-demo in same folder. Or fix gradle settings according to projects location. This repository was created as request from gwt google plus group member.
# Warning
Try to avoid spaces within path to projects. Gradle (or maybe poor settings of project) have problem with space and gradle tasks throw errors
# Current project content:
* background image on which few filters are applied
* one larger bunny with mouse click interaction + some filter
* second bunny with no interaction
* one test particle form bunnies
* animated particle created from coins (resources taken from [Pixi particles demo](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi-particles))
# Warning
This demo will be updated alongw with [Pixi gwt](https://github.com/klaun76/gwt-pixi) because this library is in early development stages and this testing project is closely dependent on [Pixi gwt](https://github.com/klaun76/gwt-pixi) library
